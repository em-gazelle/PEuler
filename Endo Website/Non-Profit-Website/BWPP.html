    <p id=explanatory>
            For years, we were told that it was normal. No matter that the pain put us in the ER, left us unconscious, and kept us away from school, work, friends...even food. Doctors chastised and mocked our pain, professors refused to make allowances, and friendships were strained as people shut us out and knocked us down when they heard the word "period." Endometriosis--a non-fatal form of cancer--affects 10-20% of women aged 8-40, and there is an average gap of 10 years between the onset of symptoms and a diagnosis. The problems don't end at diagnosis, but this gap causes undue hardship for young girls. Part of the Bloody Warriors 5K's mission is to attack this taboo, recognizing that current societal attitudes towards "menstruation" and "periods" cause young girls with Endo to suffer unduly for years, as they hesitate to or are chastised for sharing the most common symptom of the disease, most commonly described as "painful periods." As millions of young girls must fight for recognition of their symptoms--and, as a result--for their lives, please join these warriors in our Bloody Warriors 5K this January in beautiful San Francisco.
